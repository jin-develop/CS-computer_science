Complexity  (N)


# Input >= 0
# functions do more work for more input
# drop all constants --> 3n, 5n, 8n all -> just n

In n^2 and n - don't consider n<1 
consider n infinity

# ignore lower order terms / ex) n^3 + n^2 + n + 5
just n^3  --> n^3 algorithm

# ignore the base of logs
math.log(2) = ln(2)
if you want to find --> ln(2) / ln(10)

# 2n = O(n)  => mean of settle

1, C == constant time
log n -- usually divine things half or times 2 == trees
n == one per item
n^2 == compare all to all - bubble sort
n! == traveling sales
